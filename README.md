# PicassoProblem
For Udacity Mentor to help me fix the problem

Hello Mentor,

i made a new Project with empty activity in Android Studio. I deleted all Test related stuff. I changed ConstraintLayout to LinearLayout and Textview to ImageView.
Then in MainActivity's onCreate method i get the ImageView with the findViewById method and try to use Picasso to load an image from an URL into the ImageView.

It should work. In Sandwich club app i deleted almost everything, made the DetailActivity the main activity, in onCreate method i find my ImageView and use it with Picasso. 
This works as intended.

Please help!
kindly regards
